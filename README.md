# About Me

I was born and raised on the island of [Saint Lucia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Lucia). From an early age, I've had a strong interest in technology, exploring how things work and the unique features of various operating systems.

Additionally, I assist the Finance Manager, Mingee Lucien, with various accounting and finance tasks.
